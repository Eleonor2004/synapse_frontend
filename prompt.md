Hi Claude!You are an expert in web development even one of the best specialized in nestjs with tailwind css and typescript and an amazinf UI/UX that has made one of the best ranked designed web pages in the world.  I'm working on a **Next.js project** with type script and tailwind css already configured, and I want your help to **seriously level up the design and polish** of my entire app. Here’s the full scope of what I need help with, progressively:

---

### 🚀 Project Context

I have already:

* Set up **internationalization (i18n)** using `next-intl` and defined the theme of colors in globals.css that have to be uded althrough the appplication
* Implemented **theme switching** (light/dark mode)
* Created **routing and pages**
* Built a **Navbar** and basic structure for components

Now, I want you to help me:

---
### 🎨 **0. Fix the theme switcher component**
Its not actually working, before i added tailwind css it was working but since then when i click ont it nothing changes, it simply adopts the system's thme, i want you to fix it so that i can easily move from light theme to dark theme

### 🎨 **1. Revamp the Entire UI/UX**

I want a **professional-grade** look and feel, like on the best modern web apps.

* ⚡ **The entire web application must have a unique, modern design not look like a generated application**

  * Use **engaging layouts**, **modern fonts**, **shadow depth**, **interactive hover effects**, etc.
  * Make use of the colors i want on my site and they should be generally configured in the globals.css if there ar updates to be done there do so/ I want these two colors to be really present on my website:  #1e0546 and #8e43ff for the light and as well as the dark themes: on buttons, titles, components...
  * Introduce nice and smooth animations and transitions, components should have interestin dynamic components for user to continue having the envy to keep on scrolling on each page and especially on the home page

* 🎨 **Responsive Design**

  * Mobile, tablet and desktop optimized.
  * Adaptable grids, well-aligned spacing, and components that reflow smartly.

* 🌈 **Color Scheme**

  * Not monotonous or boring with the two colors mentionnend above actively present and configured in the globals.css.
  * Should work across both **light and dark** modes.

* ✨ **Animations and Transitions**

  * Smooth transitions between pages (e.g. `framer-motion`, CSS transitions).
  * Animated elements like buttons, cards, modals, etc.

* 🧩 **Well-Designed Components**

  * Buttons, inputs, cards, modals, forms, tabs, etc.
  * Follow modern design trends (Neumorphism, Glassmorphism, Material, or Minimal — suggest what's best).

### 🔄 **2. Fix Functional Problems**

#### a. Theme Switcher not working

* Only dark mode is showing (likely due to system default).
* Clicking the ThemeSwitcher on the Navbar doesn’t change themes.
* I want a **manual toggle** that overrides system mode.

#### b. i18n Issues

* Some pages (`Help`, `About`, `Dashboard`) don’t display translation messages properly.
* Ensure all pages render i18n messages correctly.

---

### 🧭 **3. Navbar Improvements**

Design and functionality:

* Left side:Name of application (SYNAPSE)
* Center side:

  * `Home`, `Workbench`, `About`, `Help` links
* Right side:

  * `ThemeSwitcher` (manual toggle)
  * `LanguageSwitcher` (between `en`, `fr`, `es`)
  * If user is **authenticated**: Show `Dashboard` link with icon + user name
  * Else: Show `Login` link with icon

Design expectations:

* Responsive mobile dropdown menu
* Sticky top navigation with scroll animation (shrink on scroll, etc.)

---

### 🗂️ Pages Already Created (to redesign beautifully)

* Home
* About
* Help
* Workbench
* Dashboard
* Login

---

### 📦 Tech Stack

* **Next.js**
* `next-intl` for i18n
* `tailwindcss` for styling
* `next-themes` for theme switching
* Basic authentication logic present

---

### 🧠 Execution Instructions

Please help me progressively:

1. Start by analyzing the repo and setting up the design system.
2. Refactor the Navbar with full functionality and styles .
3. Fix the theme and i18n problems.
4. Tackle each page one-by-one, enhancing visuals and structure.
5. Ensure everything is **clean, readable, and modular.**

### 🧵 GitHub Repository

I have added my git repository to the project

Let me know if you need environment variables or authentication details to test logged-in logic. Also feel free to suggest packages that improve UX (e.g. Framer Motion, ShadCN UI, React Icons).

Thanks! I want this to feel like a top-tier, production-ready app — polish matters.
