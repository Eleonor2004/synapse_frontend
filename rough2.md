I am working on a web application that displays a Network Graph and Location graph of data from imported Excel sheets or zip of excel sheets . Now we will be moving to ameliorations of this page for it to satisfy all our specifications on design only not absolute no change in the flow of data nor on the logic of the core functionlities of the NetworkGraph or LocationGraph: 
 I need help improving the user interface and UX behavior of the platform. For all modifications do not remove my logic of visualization or changes in my design performe only the work i asked for and give me the full code of updates components or pages.Below is a detailed description  areas that need refinement: 
 - On the page we should see Upon page load well centralised:, the interface displays a drop zone where users can upload Excel files and  Below the list of past anlysis is displayed and he can select one to visualize.
 -  When a user uploads or selects a listing, the data is visualized as a Network Graph by default. An icon should allow switching between the Network Graph and a Location Graph. A hover on a node triggers a component that displays the nodeâ€™s details(just like on the version we were having previouly just like on the screenshot attached to my prompt), and a corresponding side panel(IndividualInfo panel) also provides related information to that node 
 -  A FilterPanel and an IndividualInfo panel are present on the left and right, respectively. These panels can be toggled open/closed to optimize viewing of the graph. After importing data, the user sees a list of sheets per document he imported. 
 -   There is an issue: when clicking a node, the layout or disposition of the graph nodes changes unintentionally. This needs to be corrected. Please help me improve this setup by: Optimizing the UI flow and transitions Improving the clarity and structure of component interactions Ensuring stability in graph layout on node click Suggesting enhancements for data import, naming, and visualization UX Recommending useful animations or visual elements that can enrich the user experience Do not change the logic but only do the changes on the interface that i required. These are my components for the workbench page, when you do the modifications as required, you send me full complete and corrected code of each component or page that i will just copy and paste in order to see the changes you made Also the data flow should be such that: You upload a file. The file is parsed on the client. The parsed data is immediately sent to the NetworkGraph or LocationGraph component for instant visualization. In the background, the data is sent to the server to be saved to the database. The visualization shoud be instant, i insist on tat for the user to have a really good experience on the app. If you find hey thinsg that should be corrected proceed to correct them. These are the codes for my pages and components. Analyze it deeply and do the corrections That I want on the central component there should be the dropzone and below the list of past analysis done and not on the left side. On the left side our filters and on the right individualInfo
